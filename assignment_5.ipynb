        "1. Imagine rolling two dice, $d_1$ and $d_2$. Let $R_{min}$ be the lesser value of the two face values. What is the probability of getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6? Which values are more or less likely compared to the roll of a single six-sided die? What is the expected value of $R_{min}$? Plot the probability and cumulative distribution functions for $R_{min}$. Compute this by hand and simulate it using the law of large numbers.\n",
        "2. Imagine rolling three dice, $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$. Let $R_{med}$ be the middle of the three face values. So if you roll 2, 3 and 4, the middle value is 3, and if you roll 2, 4, 4, the middle value is 4, and so on. What is the probability of getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6? Which values are more or less likely compared to the roll of a single six-sided die? What is the expected value of $R_{med}$? Plot the probability and cumulative distribution functions for $R_{med}$. I recommend using simulations and the law of large numbers.\n",
        "3. Imagine rolling a die. If you roll 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, add that number to your total and stop; if you roll a six, add that number to your total and roll the die again. So you could roll, say, two sixes and then a four, and get a total of 16, or one three and get a total of 3, or twelve sixes and 1 and get 72, and so on. Write code to simulate this process, and determine its expected value using the law of large numbers. What is the probability of getting a total of 1, 2, 3, ... and so on, in your simulation? I recommend using simulations and the law of large numbers.  (Hint: The `while` loop might be useful in this case.)"
